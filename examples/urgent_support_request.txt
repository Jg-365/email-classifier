Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to request urgent assistance with my account access issue. I've been unable to log into the system since yesterday, and I need to submit an important report by 5 PM today.

The error message I'm receiving is "Authentication failed - invalid credentials" even though I'm using the correct username and password. I tried resetting my password using the forgot password link, but the reset email never arrived in my inbox (I've checked spam folder as well).

Could someone from the technical support team please help me resolve this issue as soon as possible? The deadline for my project submission is approaching quickly, and I cannot afford any further delays.

My employee ID is EMP12345 and my registered email is john.doe@company.com.

I would greatly appreciate a quick response and solution to this problem.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
John Doe
Senior Project Manager
